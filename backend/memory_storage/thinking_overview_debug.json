      "full_thinking": "The user wants me to explain the concept of \"光合作用\" (photosynthesis). Let me analyze the input:\n\n- concept_name: \"光合作用\"\n- subject: \"生物\" (biology)\n- topic: \"生物-植物生理-光合作用\"\n- memory_summary: \"新用户\" (new user)\n- context: Not provided\n- source_content: Not provided\n\nThis is a biology concept. The user is a new user, so I should keep the explanation at an easy to medium level, focusing on intuition and clear examples.\n\nFollowing the guidelines:\n1. **Assess Complexity**: This is a fundamental biology concept taught in middle/high school. It's a SIMPLE to MEDIUM complexity topic. I should provide clear intuition, formal definition, and multiple concrete examples.\n\n2. **Plan Structure**:\n   - Intuition: Use everyday analogy (food factory)\n   - Formal definition: Standard chemical equation\n   - Why it matters: Energy source for life, oxygen production\n   - Examples: 3 diverse examples (leaf color, day/night difference, greenhouse effect)\n   - Common mistakes: 2 typical misconceptions\n   - Related concepts: 4 related concepts\n   - Difficulty: easy (for new user)\n   - Reasoning summary: Should be concise in Chinese\n\n3. **Draft Content**:\n   - Intuition: \"植物的'食物制造工厂'\" analogy\n   - Formal definition: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂\n   - Why it matters: Foundation of food chains, oxygen supply\n   - Examples:\n     1. Why leaves are green (chlorophyll)\n     2. Day/night oxygen difference\n     3. Greenhouse CO₂ enrichment\n   - Common mistakes:\n     1. Plants only photosynthesize, don't respire\n     2. All plant cells can photosynthesize\n   - Related concepts: Chloroplast, respiration, carbon cycle, ecosystem energy flow\n   - Difficulty: easy\n   - Reasoning summary: \"基础概念，3个生活化例子，针对新用户\" (10 tokens)\n\nI need to make sure I provide at least 2-3 detailed examples. Since the user is new, I'll provide 3 clear, relatable examples.\n\nLet me structure the JSON properly according to the schema.",
